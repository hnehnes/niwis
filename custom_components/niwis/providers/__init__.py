"""Groundwater data providers for the (future) ``grundwasser_de`` integration.

Germany's groundwater monitoring is federal: the BfG's nationwide NIWIS network
(which additionally publishes a low-water *class*) plus one dense state network
per Bundesland. The long-term goal (see ``docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md``) is a single
integration with interchangeable **providers** behind one common interface, so
the config flow can offer the genuinely nearest station across all sources.

This subpackage introduces that interface (:mod:`.base`) and the first
state-network provider, LfU Brandenburg (:mod:`.lfu_bb`). The existing NIWIS
client (``custom_components/niwis/api.py``) will be adapted to the same interface
in a later step; it is intentionally left untouched for now so the shipping
integration stays stable.
